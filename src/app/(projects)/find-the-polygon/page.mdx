Find the Polygon is an educational browser game that explores the concept of
spatial dimensions by letting the player interact with the cross-sections of
various geometric shapes. I created the game for the 2020 Luxembourg Tech School
Game Development Challenge.

## About the Game

The aim of the game is to discover various 2D polygons hidden in cross-sections
of 3D polyhedra. To achieve this, one must rotate and displace each polyhedron
so that it fits the final cross-section.

As the game progressively becomes harder, with more complicated shapes and more
difficult starting rotations.

## Demo

Feel free to [give the game a try](https://find-the-polygon.vercel.app). I have
compiled it to WebGL, so you can run it in your browser.

## Source Code

The compiled WebGL source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nico-bachner/find-the-polygon). Sadly, I have lost
the original source code.
