## Purpose

The goal of the project is to design an algorithm that can optimally solve the
[Norwegian Public Broadcasting Organisation](https://www.nrk.no)'s
[Former Minigame](https://www.nrk.no/former-1.17105310), which is believed to be
NP-Hard.

To visualise test scores of different algorithms against the game, I ended up
fully [reverse engineering the original](https://nrk-former.vercel.app). The
algorithm suggests the best move to make based on the current board state. By
iterating through the steps individually in this way, it is easier to see what
steps are being taken and what potential fine-tuning the algorithm could benefit
from.

So far, a simple greedy approach has achieved the best score (solved the game in
the least number of turns). However, it is only able to look 4 moves into the
future before it becomes too slow to be usable. This is because the current
implementation has a running time of $O(n^m)$, where $n$ is the size of the
board, and $m$ is the (unknown) minimum number of turns needed to solve the
game. Fortunately, in most permutations of the board, $m \lt 20$. With proper
branch pruning, solving the game in a reasonable amount of time should
theoretically be possible.

## Gameplay

The aim of the game is to rid the board of all the tiles in as few moves as
possible. The player plays against themselves by trying to beat their high
score.
