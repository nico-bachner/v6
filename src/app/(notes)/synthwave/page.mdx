In the hotly debated topic of which genre is the best programming music,
synthwave is an underrated choice. It caters to the senses through beautiful
melodies, while not being distracting thanks to its repetitiveness and lack
(mostly) of vocals.

Not only is synthwave suited for focused work, but through its reimagining of
80's optimism for the future, it can also inspire us.

## Artists

Here is my collection of synthwave artists, grouped and sorted by their country
of origin.

I find it interesting to see where the innovation hotspots are when it comes to
the composition of new synthwave tracks. So far, there have been 3 cities that
house a significant proportion of the world's synthwave artists, namely Lyon,
Stockholm and Pittsburgh. Other notable locations include Melbourne, Montreal
and Copenhagen
