description: A collection of music of the synthwave genre

In the hotly debated topic of which genre is the best programming music, synthwave is an underrated choice. It caters to the senses through beautiful melodies, while not being distracting thanks to its repetitiveness and lack (mostly) of vocals.

Not only is syntwave suited for focused work, but through its reimagining of 80's optimism for the future, it can also inspire us.

## Artists

Here is my collection of synthwave artists, grouped and sorted by their country of origin.

<Artists />

I find it interesting to see where the innovation hotspots are when it comes to the composition of new synthwave tracks. So far, there have been 3 cities that house a significant proportion of the world's synthwave artists, namely Nice (France), Stockholm (Sweden) and Pittsburgh (PA, USA). Other notable locations are Melbourne, Montreal and Copenhagen
