## Hardware

### Laptop

I use the **2020 M1 MacBook Air**. It's light and portable, but at the same time
it can handle pretty much anything I throw at it.

### Display

To ensure compatibility with my MacBook (something that has bitten me in the
back multiple times in the past), I use the **LG UltraFine 5K Display**.

## Command Line

### Shell

My default shell is the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com). The **syntax
highlighting** is nice, and the **inbuilt autocompletion** is a killer feature.
Fish also comes with a few other small improvements, such as mapping `..` to
`cd ..`.

I am also keeping an eye out for [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh), a promising
project with a growing userbase. It reimagines some parts of the traditional
shell, such as `ls` output, which is structured in Nu, making it **easy to sort
and filter**.

### Shell Prompt

As a shell prompt, I use [Starship](https://starship.rs). It's cool because it
**shows information relevant to the current directory**, such as:

- Name of current directory
- Git branch (& status)
- Node.js version
- Time the last command took to execute

Starship is also a **cross-shell** prompt, so it integrates smoothly with both
Fish and Nu.

### Package Manager

When it comes to installing stuff. I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the go-to
package manager for MacOS. It's great because it both simple and reliable.

## Applications

### System Command Prompt

Instead of MacOS Spotlight, I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), an
application that significantly improves upon the concept of a command prompt,
with **loads of built-in features** and **installable extensions** to add even
more.

### Browser

My main browser is the MacOS default browser,
[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). Despite its bad reputation, it's
**good-looking** and it works well with _Keychain_, Apple's built-in password
manager, so there is **no need to use a 3rd party password manager**.

During development, I also test on
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

On the rare occasion that a site refuses to work in Safari (I'm looking at you,
Teams), I reluctantly fall back to Chrome.

### Text Editor

My daily driver is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Not only
do I use VS Code for code, but I also write virtually everything else in there.
In contrast to word processors such as Microsoft Word, VS Code, not being a
WYSIWYG, doesn't allow you to format text, leaving me with one less excuse to
procrastinate.

VS Code also has an **amazing ecosystem of extensions**. Those I use are listed
in my [Mac Setup](/mac-setup) process.

### Terminal

I use the default MacOS Terminal. Many people use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com),
but I prefer the default terminal. MacOS ships with it, and it serves its
purpose. End of story.

In terms of Terminal configuration, I set the font to be Fira Code (12pt) to
make [Starship](#shell-prompt) render properlyq.

## Services

### Code Hosting

I host all of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com). Most of my code
repositories are **public** and **open source**. I also use private GitHub
repositories for personal projects, such as essays, etc.

### Deployment

All of my web-based projects are deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Being
the creators and maintainers of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), their platform is
**specifically designed to host Next.js applications**, but they also support
plain HTML, [other JS frameworks](https://vercel.com/new/templates), and even
[other languages](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/supported-languages).
They also offer a [generous free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing), which is an
added bonus.

## Miscellaneous

### Fonts

[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) is my go-to sans-serif font. I came across Inter
because [Vercel](https://vercel.com) uses it for their interfaces, and I really
enjoy the **clean look and feel** of
[their design system](https://vercel.com/design).

Lately, I've been enjoying [Fraunces](https://undercase.xyz/fonts/fraunces) for
serif text.

For code (monospace), I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
because of the **awesome ligatures** it ships with. I have it enabled both in VS
Code and in the default MacOS terminal.
