## Style Guide

### Colour

| Element                         | Code                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Heading Text (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) | `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100` |
| Body Text (`p`)                 | `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` |
| Separator (e.g. `<hr>`)         | `border-gray-500/20`               |
| Background                      | `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-950`      |

### Elevation

Elevation uses a combination of glassmorphism and shadows. The effect of the shadows is more pronounced in light mode, whereas in dark mode the brightness of an element corresponds to its elevation.

| Height | Code                        |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1      | `dark:bg-gray-900 shadow `  |
| 2      | `bg-white/10 shadow-lg -lg` |

Elevation has a componding effect. When differentiating a level 2 element from a level 1 element when superpositioned, a height of 1 can be used to achieve the same effect as independently using a height of 2.
