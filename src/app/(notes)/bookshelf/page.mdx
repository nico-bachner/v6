justice.

## Fiction

As a child, I mostly read fiction, having been introduced to the genre from an
early age by my mother. This lasted until I was about 12 years old. Of the
novels I read during that period, these are the ones I continue to look back on
with nostalgia:

| Title                    | Author                   | Language |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Artemis Fowl             | Eoin Colfer              | EN       |
| Harry Potter             | J. K. Rowling            | EN       |
| Percy Jackson (universe) | Rick Riordan             | EN       |
| Le Petit Prince          | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | FR       |
| Sherlock Holmes          | Arthur Conan Doyle       | EN       |
| A Song of Ice and Fire   | George R. R. Martin      | EN       |

## Non-fiction

Around the age of 12/13, the high school curriculum had an agenda to push - one
that partially siphoned away my joy of reading. Because of this, I increasingly
shifted towards reading non-fiction. I was especially enamoured by the type I
like to call _world-building_ - largely learnings about human nature in a
historical context. Here are those whose messages resonated deeply with me:

| Title       | Author            | Language |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Factfulness | Hans Rosling      | EN       |
| Humankind   | Rutger Bregman    | EN       |
| Life 3.0    | Max Tegmark       | EN       |
| Sapiens     | Yuval Noah Harari | EN       |

## Philosophical fiction (a.k.a. something in between)

Upon nearing the end of high school, I was gradually sinking into the depths of
depression. This was a dark time for me, and I was on the constant lookout for
reasons to keep on living. That search led me back to some of the French
literary classics I had previously read in class (I had a wonderful teacher
during my last few years), as well as even further back to some childrens books,
both of which I proceeded to re-read in a new light. I also started looking
other places for more material, such as amongst classical German literature.

| Title               | Author                   | Language |

| L'Étranger          | Albert Camus             | FR       |
| Le Mythe de Sisyphe | Albert Camus             | FR       |
| Le Petit Prince     | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | FR       |
| Siddhartha          | Hermann Hesse            | DE       |
| Steppenwolf         | Hermann Hesse            | DE       |
